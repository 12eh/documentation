Consortia
=========

Consortia are groups of schools on Handshake. They allow for easy sharing of data and cross-school communications.

Sharing Within a Consortium
---------------------------

Handshake allows users to share events, career fairs and interview schedules with other schools. In addition, if a school is a member of any consortia, they are given the option to share with their whole consortium. This effectively shares with each school with one click instead of many.
