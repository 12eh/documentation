Document and Profile Review
===========================

Career services staff may turn on the document review or profile review option. These options require that student documents are reviewed and approved before being used in applications. These options can be turned on in the School Settings.

Using the Review System
-----------------------

The profile and document review interface is a single page which cycles through users one at a time. The users are ordered in order of submission date, first in first out.

Users are reviewed one at a time and each user is reviewed as a whole including their profile and all documents. The profile and documents can be navigated on the left hand side with the content on the right. Each item is reviewed individually.

Skipping Users
##############

Users can be skipped. Skipping a user puts them at the end of the queue.

Approving All and Future
########################

Once a user is trusted to upload acceptable document and profile content, they may be approved for all future content. With this option they will no longer require approval before using documents.

Providing Feedback
##################

Feedback can be added to profiles and documents using either the messaging feature or commenting feature on documents. At this point there is no inline comments for document review.

Using the API
-------------

In addition to setting a user's profile or document review status on the interface, the statuses may also be set through the API and user sync. This allows, for example, to set a certain subset of users as automatically approved.
