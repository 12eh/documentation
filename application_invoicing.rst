Invoicing
=========

As a part of the payment processing features in Handshake, Invoicing is included. Employers can be invoiced for career fair registrations and interview schedules. Invoicing sends emails to the relevant parties with the invoice details.

Sending an Invoice

Recipients

You are able to choose the recipients of an invoice. The potential recipients include the registrants and the associated contacts.

**Invoice Number**: Each invoice has an associated number. This is a readonly field for your reference.
**Amount**: The amount will be automatically filled to the correct amount, but this can be changed for unique scenarios.
**Subject**: This will be the subject of the email recieved.
**Custom Message**: If you have any extra details to send, specify them here. A default message will be filled for career fair registrations.

Once the invoice is sent, an email with details about the invoice will arrive shortly. Details in the invoice include the invoice number, subject, custom message, contact information, previously paid charges, previous invoices, itemized list of the invoice amounts, and directions on how to pay.

Registration Invoicing

For career fair registrations we take into account the booth option, extra items and discounts applied for the invoice total. For more information on career fair registrations, please see the :ref:`Career Fairs Page <application_career_fairs>`.
