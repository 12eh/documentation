You can host and manage your on campus events in Handshake. Events in Handshake include Information Sessions, Workshops, Group Appointments and 'Other'  events. Events have attendee management with registrations and checkins, payments, comments section and more. Note that :ref:`Career Fairs <application_career_fairs>` and :ref:`Interview Schedules <application_interview_schedules>` are considered special types of events in Handshake and have their own dedicated feature sets.
