Bulk Actions
============

Bulk actions are available on most manage and search pages. They provide a powerful way to interact with multiple records at a time.

Choosing Items to Act On
------------------------

There are three ways to choose what records you want to act on.

Checkboxes
##########

If you are working with a small (less than a page) amount of records, you may check the records of interest in order to apply the bulk action to those specific records.

Filtering
#########

To act on records that meet a certain set of filtering criteria, simply filter down to the records of interest and perform the bulk action. The action will be performed on each page of results.

All Records
###########

To act on all records, do not filter nor check any checkboxes and all records will be included. This will apply to each page of results, so be careful!

Confirmation
------------

Because bulk actions are so powerful, we require confirmation before performing the action. This is to help ensure mistakes are not made. If the number of records being acted on is particularly high we will also ask you to type the number of records into a confirmation input, just to be sure.
