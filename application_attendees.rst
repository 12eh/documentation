Attendees
=========

Attendees are how students RSVP and attend events in Handshake. Attendee records can have a survey response for customizable survey questions, are attached to the student profile and can also require payment. Career fairs and events are attendable in Handshake.

Statuses of Attendees
---------------------

There are multiple ways an attendee status may be changed.

Registering
###########

To register for an event, click the 'Register' button when viewing an attendable. By registering, the attendee record is now 'registered'.

Checking In
###########

Students can checkin to attendables using the :ref:`checkin kiosk<application_checkin_kiosk>`. Once checked in, the attendee record will be denoted as such.

Paid
########

If an attendable requires payment, attendees have a payment status. Payment will be prompted for during the registration process and students will not be allowed to register without paying. Payment is done using our :ref:`integration with Stripe<application_stripe>`.

Viewing Attendee List
---------------------

All attendables have a user interface for reviewing the attendee list. On the attendee review page, you can review all aspects of the attendee. This includes:

* basic student details
* student profile
* registration, checked in, and payment status
* survey question responses

In addition to the interface option, attendee lists can be downloaded for further processing.
