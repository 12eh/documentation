RSS Feeds
=========

The recommended option for easily and safely exporting data from Handshake is through RSS feeds. RSS feeds are live, readonly feeds of events, jobs or career fairs. Each RSS Feed has a private unique link for loading the data.

Creating an RSS Feed
--------------------

RSS Feeds include two steps. The first step is specifying the name and category, and the second step is scoping the data you want in the feed. Once the feed is set up, the final page can be used to generate the URL.

Using RSS Feed
--------------

RSS Feeds can be used for different integrations. Examples may include a list of upcoming events, "hot jobs" using labelling, or newly posted jobs. You may want to consult IT to help set up and make use of your feed. Note that through the nature of RSS Feeds, data is made public without requiring authentication, and care should be given in handling the external facing RSS Feed links.
